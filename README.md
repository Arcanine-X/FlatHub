# Flathub

Flathub was a project that was creating in Summer of Techs 2018 Create Camp. On this 2 day hackathon the team of 4 consisting of 3 developers and 1 designer designed a website finding flats for university students. It was created using the TradeMe Flatmates API call where infomation was filtered out based on the district and max rent the student wants to pay. The filtered out flats were then presented on the screen.
